    1. Introduction to Metaphysics
</h1>
<h1 id="law-as-a-subset-of-ethics" class="header">Law as a Subset of Ethics</h1>
<p>Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of the universe as a whole and contains within its field of study the most fundamental knowledge possible. It is the study of existence as such or, 'being qua being;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[. . .] the essence of metaphysics, according to Objectivism, is the step-by-step development of the corollaries of the existence axiom.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is there? What is man? What is? These & similar questions are answered by metaphysics. Epistemology, ethics, aesthetics, law, and all other branches of philosophy derive from metaphysics. However, metaphysics' job is not to tell us everything about everything. It describes what holds true of a thing just insofar as it exists. Metaphysics, then, is meant to deal with the most fundamental facts of reality.</p>
<h1 id="2.-the-fundamental-axioms-of-metaphysics">2. The Fundamental Axioms of Metaphysics</h1>
<h2 id="2.1.-what-is-an-axiom?">2.1. What is an Axiom?</h2>
<p>An axiom is an irreducible primary, something that is not only taken to be true, but must be taken to be true. Any denial of the fundamental basic axioms implies an immediate contradiction. Many state that the axioms are not (or perhaps cannot be)  validated, but this is untrueâ€”as stated before. The philosopher does not start at an arbitrary point in time, or an arbitrary premise. He starts at the beginning, where any further question cannot be reduced any further.</p>
<p>In philosophy, an axiom is like the most basic building blockâ€”it's where you have to begin, and you can't get around it when you are attempting to form any sound logic or observation. Axioms are something we don't prove because proving things depends on axioms in the first place. Instead, we must validate that axioms are true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An axiomatic concept is [. . .] the identification of a primary fact of reality, which cannot be analyzed, i.e., reduced to other facts or broken into component parts. It is implicit in all facts and in all knowledge. It is the fundamentally given and directly perceived or experienced, which requires no proof or explanation, but on which all proofs and explanations rest.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Validation is the fundamental tool that analyzes how well an idea matches the real world. It can use different methods like logical reasoning (induction), gathering evidence (induction), or just seeing something to make sure the idea makes sense (also induction). Axioms, in this case, are self-evident ideas that we can be entirely certain about because we see or experience them directly, and it wouldn't make any logical sense to say they're not true.</p>
<h2 id="2.2.-existence">2.2. Existence</h2>
<p>The core idea of philosophyâ€”of objective reality, is that it all starts with one crucial concept: "Existence exists." In the book "Atlas Shrugged," the main character John Galt talks to a society falling apart:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Existence existsâ€“and the act of grasping that statement implies two corollary axioms: that something exists which one perceives and that one exists possessing consciousness, consciousness being the faculty of perceiving that which exists.<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "existence" axiom is inescapable. Any effort to deny it necessarily involves its usage and implicit acceptance<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup>. If something exists, it must exist within existence. Any deviation from this leads to utter catastropheâ€”a complete failure to any form of logical philosophy.</p>
<p>It is by rejecting the axiom that existence is an eternal entity with no start or end, that you have cut your ontological fruit tree at the roots, meaning no philosophical nutrients can derive anywhere past this. Any idea, concept, or percept, is a floating abstraction<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup> with no concrete premise to latch ontoâ€”it is entirely illogical.</p>
<p>Practically this is equivalent to shoving a dead flower stem into the dirt and expecting it to grow, there is no root, and there is no support, what is the plant supposed to grow off of when there is no logical basis or root to support any of the myriad of ideas to come from it? Let us analyze a philosophy that rejects existence at the coreâ€”theological philosophy. Such a philosophy can be snipped from the root, but rather they did this for us. So there is no need for us to do anything else but to explain how. It is because of this, that existence is a fundamental self-evident axiom.</p>
<p>The term "existence" serves as a collective noun encompassing everything that occupies reality. The statement, in essence, reaffirms the presence of all that exists. This form of "repetition" is the sole method to articulate, as a proposition, the fundamental truth encapsulated by the concept of "existence." The term "existence exists" is a correct usage of tautology. The axiom "existence exists" serves as an articulation of the concept "existence," and it inevitably takes the form of a repetition. This is due to the nature of "existence" itselfâ€”it is an axiomatic concept, inherently irreducible and unanalyzable at its core.</p>
<h2 id="2.3.-consciousness">2.3. Consciousness</h2>
<p>Refer back to Galt's Speech, there you will find the definition of the 2nd and next fundamental axiom, consciousness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[. . .] and that one exists possessing consciousness, consciousness being the faculty of perceiving that which exists.<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7" role="doc-backlink">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, consciousness is the faculty of perceiving that which exists. Being aware isn't just a passive state; it's an active thing. When it comes to basic awareness, our brain functions correctly to turn sensations into meaningful perceptions, but we don't control this process consciously. We're aware of the outcomes, not how our brain does it. At a higher, thinking level, our awareness is a product of our thoughts, our choices, and our intent. In both cases, consciousness takes ongoing and continuous action</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Directly or indirectly, every phenomenon of consciousness is derived from one's awareness of the external world. Some object, i.e., some content, is involved in every state of awareness. Extrospection is a process of cognition directed outwardâ€”a process of apprehending some existent(s) of the external world. Introspection is a process of cognition directed inwardâ€”a process of apprehending one's own psychological actions in regard to some existent(s) of the external world, such actions as thinking, feeling, reminiscing, etc. It is only in relation to the external world that the various actions of a consciousness can be experienced, grasped, defined, or communicated. Awareness is awareness of something. A contentless state of consciousness is a contradiction in terms.<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8" role="doc-backlink">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consciousness is natural. The idea that consciousness is connected to mysticism does not hold up when we take into account basic logic. Consciousness is a quality found in living beings on Earth, and it's something we can directly experience through empirical observation of existence. It has a specific nature (identity). It has a functionâ€”it is to help us understand the world around us and survive. There's nothing mystical or supernatural about it. There's no evidence to suggest that consciousness can exist separately from the natural world, and it's not related to any ideas of immortality or other-worldly realms.</p>
<p>An ordinary materialist would say that consciousness is unnaturalâ€“you can't see it, touch it, or measure it like you can with physical objects. But if we apply the same logic to our eyes, we could say that they're not real because you can't examine them from within, they don't have the qualities of awareness, and they can't think or feel emotions. Both arguments are similar, and it doesn't make sense to only accept the existence of physical things while denying consciousness. The truth is that both matter and consciousness exist, and we use consciousness to perceive matter.<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9" role="doc-backlink">9</a></sup></p>
<p>The fact of consciousness is and must be an irreducible prim- aryâ€“an inescapable factâ€“a fundamental starting pointâ€“in any act of cognition. No matter the particular subject matter that a man studies, it must be true that he is studying something, which means he is studying something. This is not, nor could it be, negated by any explanation of consciousness, contrary to what some think: that scientists uncover the physical mechanisms that underlie consciousness does not negate consciousness, and similarly that religious mystics uncover some spiritual "soul" driving conscious thought would also not negate consciousness. Ultimately both the mystics of spirit and the mystics of muscle are still engaged in a study of something that existsâ€”they are and must be conscious. To state quite literally anything is to presuppose knowledge of something in particularâ€“knowledge is only attainable by a conscious beingâ€“consciousness is validated in this sense.<sup><a id="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10" role="doc-backlink">10</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="2.4.-identity">2.4. Identity</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you seeking to know what is wrong with the world? All the disasters that have wrecked your world, came from your leaders' attempt to evade the fact that A is A. All the secret evil you dread to face within you and all the pain you have ever endured, came from your own attempt to evade the fact that $A$ is $A$. The purpose of those who taught you to evade it, was to make you forget that Man is Man.<sup><a id="fnr.11" class="footref" href="#fn.11" role="doc-backlink">11</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, the next fundamental axiom is identity. The fact that $A$ is $A$. A leaf is a leaf, a stone is a stone, things are what they are, nothing else. It would be a contradiction for things to be what they are not; $A$ is $\neg A$. To exist means being unique in contrast to everything else. An object's "identity" means what it is, its qualities or characteristics, and its essential nature. This concept differs slightly from the idea of existence, which sets apart something from nothing, whereas identity distinguishes one thing from another. But existence does imply identity. To be is to be something.</p>
<p>This law is, along with existence and consciousness, an axiom: a fundamental and inescapable starting point of knowledge. Wherever a man is studying something, he is studying something as opposed to some other thingâ€”just as he must be studying something as opposed to nothing. The "thing" is the identification. </p>
<p>Things are limited by their form, consider an apple suddenly able to gain sentience. This would be a miracle because an apple does not have the capacity to become conscious, it is limited by its identity.</p>
<p>From this, we can arrive at the law of non-contradiction. Indeed this law is self-evident from the law of identity. If you say that the law of non-contradiction doesn't exist, then it simultaneously does and doesn't exist, but if it does exist then it can't not exist at the same time. Justification of $A$ is $\neg A$ would fail. One would prove himself wrong that $A$ is by his own statement that it isn't. Therefore the law of non-contradiction must be true.</p>

<h1 id="3.-validating-the-axioms">3. Validating the Axioms</h1>
<h2 id="3.1.-can-the-axioms-be-proven?">3.1. Can the Axioms be Proven?</h2>
<p>The novice often asks, "May you provide a proof of the axioms?" This makes sense at first, intuitively; proof is our means of justifying any other proposition, so why would the axioms differ? </p>
<p>What makes the axioms special (as well as future corollaries we might see)? It is that these axioms and corollaries are presupposed and required for proof itself. Imagine starting a proof without existence. As to prove is to prove something about reality, one cannot prove anything at all. Consciousness is a similar matter; if we cannot perceive existents, then how can we demonstrate any knowledge, and thus proof, about them? Then identity; if some things aren't what they are, what can be proven about them in the first place?</p>
<h2 id="3.2.-axioms-as-validated-by-perception">3.1. Axioms as Validated by Perception</h2>
<p>If axioms may not be validated by proof, how may they be validated at all? Is it simply the case that proof is impossible for us in the first place?</p>
<p>As proof is a reduction to certain premises, it is in fact impossible to prove everything; this leads to an infinite regress<sup><a id="fnr.12" class="footref" href="#fn.12" role="doc-backlink">12</a></sup>. Aristotle explains this on the law of contradiction (a corollary of identity):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are some who, as we have said, both themselves assert that it is possible for the same thing to be and not to be, and say that people can judge this to be the case. And among others many writers about nature use this language. But we have now posited that it is impossible for anything at the same time to be and not to be, and by this means have shown that this is the most indisputable of all principles.â€” Some indeed demand that even this shall be demonstrated, but this they do through want of education, for not to know of what things one may demand demonstration, and of what one may not, argues simply want of education. For it is impossible that there should be demonstration of absolutely everything; there would be an infinite regress, so that there would still be no demonstration. But if there are things of which one should not demand demonstration, these persons cannot say what principle they regard as more indemonstrable than the present one.<sup><a id="fnr.13" class="footref" href="#fn.13" role="doc-backlink">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The method of validating axioms (as we shall see later) is the same as validating any other source of knowledge; through looking at the world, and taking in what we observe. Validation is simply a broader form of proofâ€“any process of relating mental contents to the facts of reality. </p>
<p>Right now, you are looking at this page; thus, you are perceiving somethingâ€”an existent. Therefore, existence exists. Next, you have recognized an existent; therefore, you have a consciousness, the faculty of perceiving existents. Finally, the page you see is the page and is not, not the page. Anything else you perceive is what it is, and isn't what it isn't. This is identity.</p>
<p>All the axioms are validated because they are the immediate conclusions of observing reality; they are not mere assumptions, nor are they mystic insights. </p>
<p>A simple process can be used to validate the axioms to the skepticâ€“a form of dialogue that will show, without a shadow of a doubt, the objectivity and necessity of the axioms. Let us take Crusoe and Friday. On a deserted island, Crusoe (A) and Friday (B) engage in a heated debate. Crusoe, channeling a radical skeptic, challenges the very foundation of reality. Friday, representing the rational individual, defends the self-evident through concrete experience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>$Crusoe$: "Your objection to the obvious holds no water. There's no such thing as disagreement. Everyone agrees on everything."</p>
<p>$Friday$: "Absurd! People disagree constantly, about everything from the taste of fruit to the direction of the stars."</p>
<p>$Crusoe$: "But how can they? There's nothing to disagree about, no objective reality. After all, nothing exists."</p>
<p>$Friday$: "Nonsense! Look around you! The sun warms our skin, the waves crash against the shore. These $things$ $exist$, and you know it as well as I do."</p>
<p>$Crusoe$: "One point granted. You've implicitly accepted the existence axiom even to utter the word 'disagreement.' But my point remains: disagreement is an illusion. How can unconscious beings, incapable of holding ideas, disagree?"</p>
<p>$Friday$: "Of course people hold ideas! We think, reason, and learn. $We$ $are$ $conscious$ beings, that much is undeniable."</p>
<p>$Crusoe$: "Another axiom conceded. But even so, why the fuss about conflicting ideas? Maybe everyone who disagrees about, say, the shape of the island is equally, objectively right."</p>
<p>$Friday$: "That's impossible! If two ideas contradict each other, they can't both be true. Reality doesn't tolerate contradictions. A thing is what it is. $A$ coconut $is$ $a$ coconut, not a pineapple."<sup><a id="fnr.14" class="footref" href="#fn.14" role="doc-backlink">14</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Through this dialogue, Crusoe's skepticism serves as a springboard for establishing the three fundamental axioms of Objectivist metaphysics: existence, consciousness, and identity. Friday's grounded responses demonstrate the self-evident nature of these axioms, rooted in their shared experience and the logic of their interactions. This exchange sets the stage for further exploration of these principles and their implications for understanding reality, knowledge, and ethics within the Objectivist framework.</p>
<p>But what of the man who rejects these basic axiomsâ€“once or after proven? What is Crusoe to do once Friday demonstrates his full rejection of the axioms? One would very well say 'ask the person for an account of how his view comes about, what arguments underlie his premises, and so on. The problem is: there isn't anyâ€“ there are no more fundamental of a premise than the three axioms. Quite simply, the only thing you can do is: disengageâ€“run awayâ€“ don't even entertain the conversation a second longer; he can only evade for so long.</p>
